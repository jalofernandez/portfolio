# Developer + Designer static website concept

An experimental page layout concept with a developer/designer theme and a special effect based on a Codrops original project ([Article on Codrops](https://tympanus.net/codrops/?p=30725)) but with many improvements like:

- Error 404, Catalog Gallery, Personal Resume, Contact, Sitemap and Legal Terms pages.
- A lot of "old fashion" computer effects (pure css) added.
- Blade Runner zeppelin animation included in some pages.
