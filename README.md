# Developer/Designer Page Layout Concept

An experimental page layout concept with a developer/designer theme and a special effect based on a Codrops original project ([Article on Codrops](https://tympanus.net/codrops/?p=30725)) but with a los of improvements like:

- Error 404, Catalog Gallery and Legal Terms added pages.
- A lot of "old fashion" computing effects (pure css) added.
- Blade Runner zeppelin animation included in error 404 page.
