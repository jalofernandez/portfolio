# Developer/Designer Page Layout Concept

An experimental page layout concept with a developer/designer theme and a special effect based on a Codrops original project ([Article on Codrops](https://tympanus.net/codrops/?p=30725)) but with a los of improvements like:

- A lot of "old fashion" computing effects (pure css) added.
- "Blade Runner" zeppelin artwork included as a background animation in some pages.
- Pages included:
    - Error 404 & 500
    - Catalog Gallery (*Portfolio*)
    - Legal Terms
    - Contact
    - Resume (*About Me*)
    - Sitemap
